## Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a leading electricity provider serving the SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) segment. Using machine learning, feature engineering, data analysis, and Power BI visualizations, the goal was to forecast which customers were most likely to churn and recommend strategic interventions to reduce churn rates and protect revenue.

## Projject Overview
The objectives of the project were:
1. Explore and analyze customer demographics, historical electricity consumption, pricing, and churn patterns.
2. Engineer meaningful features to enhance predictive performance.
3. Develop machine learning models to classify customers at risk of churning.
4. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
5. Visualize key trends and model outputs through Power BI dashboards.
6. Formulate targeted churn reduction strategies, especially for high-value customers.

The project was completed over a 3-week period as part of a hackathon challenge, emphasizing business impact, analytical clarity, and model robustness.

## Data Sources:
1. Customer Data: Includes client characteristics such as industry, historical electricity consumption, and date joined.
2. Churn Data: Indicates whether a customer has churned.
3. Historical Price Data: Shows the prices charged to each customer for electricity and gas at various intervals.

Data preparation involved:
- Handling missing values.
- Merging multiple data sources.
- Creating derived features (e.g., price sensitivity indicators, consumption variability).
- Identifying churn-driving patterns.

## Outcomes
1. Built and validated predictive models, achieving strong performance metrics in classifying churn risk.
2. Key features identified influencing churn included:
- Historical pricing fluctuations.
- Industry sector sensitivity.
- Patterns in electricity consumption.
- Developed a Power BI dashboard highlighting:
- Churn rates across industries and consumption levels.
- Customer value segmentation vs. churn likelihood.
- Price sensitivity and its relationship with churn.

## Recommended targeted strategies:
1. Implement loyalty incentives and flexible pricing for high-value, price-sensitive customers.
2. Offer tailored retention packages based on consumption behavior and industry type.
3. Improve communication and engagement strategies for customers showing early churn signals.

These strategies were aimed at reducing churn rates, improving customer lifetime value, and stabilizing revenue streams.
